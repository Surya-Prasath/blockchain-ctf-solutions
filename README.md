# Security Innovation Blockchain CTF
Security Innovation conducted a Smart Contracts CTF named [Security Innovation Blockchain CTF](https://blockchain-ctf.securityinnovation.com/#/) in April 2018. It is considered to be a good place for beginners.

## Introduction
This repository comprises of the concepts needed to solve the questions from this CTF along with proper step by step solutions. In order to properly utilize these resources, one is recommended to try the questions first and then follow the given instructions.

## Prerequistes
Basics of Solidity, the programming language used to code smart contracts. Although, if you know basics of any broadly used programming language like JavaScript, you could manage through starting problems.

Sources for learning Solidity :
* [Crypto Zombies](https://cryptozombies.io/)
* [Solidity Official Docs](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/)

## Instructions
Every challenge has a dedicated sub-directory. Every sub-directory has a ```concept.md``` which outlines the theory needed for solving that paritcular challenge. It also contains ```solution.md``` which gives instructions for practical implementation of the concepts disscussed.

## Feedback
All kind of feedback is welcome. Please open an Issue in this repository.
